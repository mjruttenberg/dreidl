# This is a project I used for practising Ruby coding, with WHILE, CASE, global variables, methods and iteratively improving my coding skills
# It is based on the children's game "dreidl".

# What is Dreidl? 
A dreidl is a 4-sided spinning top, which you spin to land on a side, each with a prize win or a penalty. 
It is a children's game of chance, played on the Jewish festival of Hanukkah (AKA Chanukah).
You traditionally play with chocolate coins ("Hanukkah gelt"), raisins, nuts or any other token. Perhaps even pennies. 
In the Jewish faith, Hanukkah is the festival of lights, and is an 8 day festival celebrating the of miracle of how, 
when the ancient Greeks seiged the Temple in Jerusalem and sacked it. The oil to light the Menorah (ritual candelabra) was insufficient
to last more than a day unti the next batch could be made. It lasted for 8 days. 
Jews celebrate the victory over the Greeks by the Maccabbees and the rededication of the Temple.
Other traditions are to eat oily foods (usually latkes [potato cakes] & doughnuts) and light the menorah [8-pronged mini candelabra].
The festival takes place in December, though moves around within the month due to the lunar calendar (offset by lunar leap months, so it always stays in December).
