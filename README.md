# # What is Dreidl? A dreidl is a 4-sided spinning top, which you spin to land on a side, each with a prize win or a penalty. 
# It is a children's game of chance, played on the Jewish festival of Hanukkah (AKA Chanukah).
# You traditionally play with chocolate coins ("Hanukkah gelt"), raisins, nuts or any other token. Perhaps even pennies. 
# In the Jewish faith, Hanukkah is the festival of lights, and is an 8 day festival celebrating the of miracle of how, 
# when the ancient Greeks seiged the Temple in Jerusalem and sacked it. The oil to light the Menorah (ritual candelabra) was insufficient
# to last more than a day unti the next batch could be made. It lasted for 8 days. 
# Jews celebrate the victory over the Greeks by the Maccabbees and the rededication of the Temple.
# Other traditions are to eat oily foods (usually latkes [potato cakes] & doughnuts) and light the menorah [8-pronged mini candelabra].
# The festival takes place in December, though moves around within the month due to the lunar calendar (offset by lunar leap months, so it always stays in December).
